# YELP-Sentiment-Analysis
Text Mining : Yelp Sentiment Analysis

Task description:
Sentiment analysis has been a popular user case for text mining to quickly and automatically gain insights of
the customers’ experience. Please find the attached yelp review dataset with 988
reviews and binary sentiment labels (p for positive and n for negative) and construct classifiers to properly
predict the sentiments from the text reviews.
Prepare the Document Term Matrix (DTM) using the provided text data and perform the sentiment analysis using multiple classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Deep Learning
and an additional supervised learning algorithm of your choice). 

Section 1: Introduction and Data Preprocessing .
Steps (e.g. tokenization, stemming, stop words removal, TF-IDF
transformation, etc. to prepare the Document Term Matrix (DTM) from the review text data. the

Section 2: Logistic regression Apply the right variant of logistic regression method to model this dataset,
given the target attribute “class” is ordinal type and not nominal type. Provide the model specifications and
proper interpretations of the model.

Section 3: Artifical neural network and deep learning Experiment with different ANN architectural parameters
(e.g. number of hidden layers, number of nodes within each nodes) as well as model parameters (activation
and loss functions, regularization, epoch/batch size, etc.)

Section 4: Algorithm performance comparison Compare the results
